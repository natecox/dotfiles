* Nate Cox's Dotfiles

** Preamble
My personal dotfiles repo. Targets nix on macOS.

** Installation
/Don't use this right now!! All of the parts are correct, but some extra work is needed to get it to run as one script./
/The nix install script requires starting a new shell, this will probably need to be broken into two parts./

#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/natecox/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
caffeinate ~/.dotfiles/setup.sh
#+end_src
