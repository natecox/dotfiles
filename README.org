* Nate Cox's Dotfiles

** Preamble
My personal dotfiles repo. I used to use fancy dotfile manager programs but I'm too cool for that now.

** Installation

#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/natecox/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
caffeinate ~/.dotfiles/setup.sh
#+end_src

*Note*: it may be necessary to log in to the App Store before running, as `brew bundle` will invoke [[https://github.com/mas-cli/mas][mas]] which requires
it.
